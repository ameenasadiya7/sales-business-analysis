## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales data to understand business performance across regions and product categories and derive actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Sample Superstore Sales Dataset.

The dataset contains order-level sales information including region, category, sales, and profit.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Analysis Performed
- Reviewed and cleaned the dataset by checking for duplicates and missing values
- Created pivot tables and charts in Excel to analyze:
  - Region-wise sales performance
  - Category-wise sales contribution
- Used Python Pandas to reproduce and validate the same analysis programmatically

## Key Insights
- Certain regions contribute significantly higher sales compared to others
- Technology and Office Supplies categories generate higher revenue
- A small number of categories contribute to a major portion of total sales

## Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing regions
- Improve strategies for underperforming regions
- Plan inventory and promotions based on category performance

## Conclusion
This mini project helped me understand the end-to-end data analytics workflow, from working with raw data to generating business insights using Excel and Python.
